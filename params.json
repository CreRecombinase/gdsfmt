It is suited for large-scale datasets, especially for data which are much larger than the available random-access memory. The gdsfmt package offers the efficient operations specifically designed for integers with less than 8 bits, since a single genetic/genomic variant, like single-nucleotide polymorphism, usually occupies fewer bits than a byte. Data compression and decompression are also supported with relatively efficient random access. It is allowed to read a GDS file in parallel with multiple R processes supported by the parallel package.\r\n\r\n\r\n## R Documents\r\n\r\nBioconductor Release Branch ([v1.4.0](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/gdsfmt.html)): [Tutorial](./release/gdsfmt_vignette.html), [Help Documents](./release/help/00Index.html)\r\n\r\nBioconductor Develop Branch ([v1.5.--](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/gdsfmt.html)): [Tutorial](./devel/gdsfmt_vignette.html), [Help Documents](./devel/help/00Index.html)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Citation\r\n\r\nZheng X, Levine D, Shen J, Gogarten SM, Laurie C, Weir BS (2012).
